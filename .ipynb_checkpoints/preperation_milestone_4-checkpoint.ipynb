    "# Milestone Four Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will begin preparing for the fourth milestone. The objective of this milestone is to train an object classification model capable of classifying the discovered cells. To successfully complete this milestone, you should follow the steps outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a Dataset Class:\n",
    "   - Create a Dataset Class specifically designed to load images from the \"crops\" directory along with their respective labels.\n",
    "   - Considering the significant class imbalance within the dataset, you will have to make use of approprriate sampling and augmentations.\n",
    "   - Resize all crops to the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop a Custom Classification Model:\n",
    "   - Instead of utilizing an existing model from PyTorch, design your own custom model for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set up Training and Validation/Test Loops:\n",
    "   - Write a training and validation/test loop for training your model.\n",
    "   - Select an appropriate optimizer and loss function to facilitate effective training.\n",
    "   - Continue training your model until convergence is observed, as indicated by the validation loss.\n",
    "   - Once training is complete, plot the training and test loss to visualize the learning progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate Model Performance:\n",
    "   - Calculate the f1-score and accuracy of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end please upload your jupyter notebook to moodle.\n"
